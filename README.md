Kamele Framework
=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goldenice/Kamele-Framework.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goldenice/Kamele-Framework)

Quite a simple framework
--------------
Kamele Framework is an awesome tiny framework, which can be used for both tiny one-page projects and big-ish applications.
It is very lightweight, and has some [pretty good documentation](http://goldenice.github.io/Kamele-Framework/ "Kamele Documentation"). I wrote it because I needed a lightweight MVC framework, and I thought other frameworks were too complicated for tiny projects.

License
--------------
Kamele is open source and licensed under the MIT license. For more information see LICENSE.txt

Contributing
--------------
You can contribute! If you think something is missing, you have a library to add, or you just want to help, e-mail me at kamele@ricklubbers.nl and we'll work something out. Alternatively you can fork this repo and create a pull request.

Helping
--------------
You can help by contribution, as mentioned above, but you can of course also help in other ways. I always like to see people using Kamele, so you can spread the word. If you like, you can buy me a cup of coffee. My bitcoin address is 19ahUNppJCShEBJ8JfcCRWYtiUwFydRRQj.
