[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goldenice/Kamele-Framework.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goldenice/Kamele-Framework)

A simple but complete framework
--------------
Kamele Framework is an awesome tiny framework, which can be used for both tiny one-page projects and big-ish applications.
It is very lightweight, and is [well documented](https://github.com/goldenice/Kamele-Framework/wiki/00-Welcome-to-Kamele-Framework "Kamele Framework Wiki").

You can help by contributing, as mentioned above, but you can of course also help in other ways. I always like to see people using Kamele, so you can spread the word. If you like, you can buy me a cup of coffee. My bitcoin address is 19ahUNppJCShEBJ8JfcCRWYtiUwFydRRQj.
