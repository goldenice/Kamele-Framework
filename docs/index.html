            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>You seem to have found Kamele Framework. Cool. It is a PHP framework based on the Model-View-Controller design pattern. It started out as a learning project for me (Rick Lubbers) and ended up as a really light-weight framework.</p>

            <h2 id="license">License</h2>
            <p>Since there wasn't a good open source license to fit my needs, I've created my own. Thing you can do:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use Kamele in your open source project</li>
                    <li>Use Kamele in your commercial project</li>
                    <li>Change the code of Kamele for you own usage</li>
                    <li>Change the code of Kamele and release it under another name</li>
                </ul>
                
                <br />Things you can't do:
                <ul>
                    <li>Claim you wrote Kamele and / or distribute it under your name</li>
                    <li>Change the code of Kamele and distribute it using the name Kamele or Kamele Framework</li>
                </ul>
                
                Pretty straightforward right? If you do have any questions about something, just contact Rick Lubbers &lt;kamele@ricklubbers.nl&gt;.

            <h2 id="globalstructure">Global Structure</h2>
            <p>Kamele Framework works with a <i>Model-View-Controller structure</i>, extended with <i>Services</i>, which provide a layer of logic code between <i>Models</i> and <i>Controllers</i>.</p>
            <p>All the different types of classes are described below. Those classes are all divided into separate modules.</p>
            
            <h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
            <p>Kamele uses modules to divide the logic between separate tiny applications, so modules can be reused easily. All modules can be found in <i>/modules</i>. Each module has exactly one subdirectory in <i>/modules</i>. One directory has to be present, namely <i>/modules/main</i>. That is the default route too. <a href="#routing">Read more about routing.</a></p>
            
            <h3 id="controllers">Controllers</h3>
            <p>The controllers used in Kamele are actually a mix between controllers and template renderers. View in Kamele are static HTML files, so the controller has to glue all those pieces of HTML together. That can be done through the <i>Layout class</i>. This class let's you substitude strings like <i>{content}</i> with dynamically loaded data, coming from services or models. So the controllers stitch data and HTML together.</p>
        
            <h3 id="models">Models</h3>
            <p>Models provide an interface to the database. Models are the only type of classes which can contain queries. Services heavily rely on models to fetch data from the database. Models do not 'know' any other part of the framework except for the <i>Database class</i>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="services">Services</h3>
            <p>Services rely heavily on models for data. Can connect with 3rd party API's over HTTP and can access files. Services essentially form the logic part of your application, whereas controllers stitch the data from the services into the HTML.</p>
            <p>Logic should always be located in services, and never in models. Models are 'dumb' objects whereas services can contain quite a bit of code. Services are considered 'smart' objects.</p>
            
            <h3 id="views">Views</h3>
            <p>Views are static pieces of HTML. They may contain placeholders like <i>{content}</i>, which are replaced by some other HTML or plain text. The controller takes care of that part. An example of a view is:
            <pre class="code">
&lt;a href="http://google.com/{suburl}"&gt; Lets go to Google.com/{suburl} ! &lt;/a&gt;</pre>
            </p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <h2 id="access">Accessing other classes</h2>
            <p>Other classes can be accessed from the $this variable. Every model, service and controller should extend the basemodel, baseservice and basecontroller defined in the system files. Those base classes preload a few classes so you can access them easily. Lets see a piece of controller code:
                <pre class="code">
namespace \Modules\nl.ricklubbers.auth\Controllers;
class Example extends \System\Basecontroller {
    function index($arg = null) {
        $this->loader['\Modules\nl.ricklubbers.auth\Services\Session']
            ->login($_POST['username'], $_POST['password']);
    }
}</pre>
            This is a piece of example code. This code accesses \Modules\nl.ricklubbers.auth\Services\Session::login() in a non-static way.</p>
            <p>Note: The database can be accessed with $this->db.</p>
            <p>Note: once an instance of a certain class has been created, this instance will be persistent throughout the entire application. There will only be one object of each class available through this interface. If you want more object or separate objects, you need to call them through the <i>new</i> statement, but that is not recommend.</p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
            <p>Routing in Kamele is done automatically. Below is a scheme of what URL routes where.
            <table>
                <tr><td>URL</td><td>Class</td><td>Function</td></tr>
                <tr><td>example.com/index.php</td><td>\Application\Controller\Home</td><td>index()</td></tr>
                <tr><td>example.com/index.php/home</td><td>\Modules\Main\Controllers\Home</td><td>index()</td></tr>
                <tr><td>example.com/index.php/home/index</td><td>\Modules\Main\Controllers\Home</td><td>index()</td></tr>
                <tr><td>example.com/index.php/user</td><td>\Modules\Main\Controllers\User\Home</td><td>index()</td></tr>
                <tr><td>example.com/index.php/user/basic</td><td>\Modules\User\Controllers\Basic</td><td>index()</td></tr>
                <tr><td>example.com/index.php/user/basic/login</td><td>\Modules\User\Controllers\Basic</td><td>login()</td></tr>
                <tr><td>example.com/index.php/user/view/page/40/2</td><td>\Modules\User\Controllers\View</td><td>page( $arg = array(40, 2) )</td></tr>
            </table><br />
            This table is pretty self-explainatory. The first part of the URL defines the module, the second part the controller, the third part the function, and the parts after that are arguments. If the module requested does not exist, then the routing will default to the module Main. If no method name is set, it defaults to Home.
            </p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <h2 id="cliusage">CLI usage</h2>
            <p>It is possible in Kamele to test your script over the command line. That is extremely useful for automated testing procedures. Instead of the REQUEST_URI, the routing will use the first argument given. If no argument is given, the default route is assumed. Furthermore, routing over the command line is the same as over HTTP(S).</p>
            <p>Examples of valid Kamele CLI calls:</p>
            <pre class="code">php index.php
php index.php main/home
php index.php main/home/
php index.php main/home/index/404/
            </pre>
